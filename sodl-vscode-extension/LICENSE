Change Date: 2030-02-16

Change License: Apache License, Version 2.0

Additional Use Grant

You may use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, publicly perform,
publicly display, and redistribute the Licensed Work for any purpose,
including commercial purposes, provided that you do not use the Licensed
Work in a Competitive Offering.

Definitions

“Competitive Offering” means a commercial product or service, offered to
third parties, that provides functionality substantially similar to the
core capabilities of SODL.

Core capabilities of SODL include, but are not limited to:

-   Developer tooling for specification or schema definition
-   Processing, interpreting, validating, or compiling SODL
    specifications
-   Infrastructure, configuration, or platform definition workflows
    enabled by SODL
-   Hosted or managed services exposing SODL’s primary functionality

A Competitive Offering includes providing the Licensed Work’s core
functionality as a hosted, managed, or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
offering to third parties.

For clarity, a Competitive Offering does not include:

-   Internal use within an organization
-   Embedding SODL within a larger proprietary system where SODL is not
    the primary commercial offering
-   Consulting or support services related to SODL
-   Open-source derivative works that are not offered commercially as a
    competing product or service

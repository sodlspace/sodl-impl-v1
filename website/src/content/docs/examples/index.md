Explore SODL specs for common project patterns. Each example is ready to use as context for your AI coding tool.

## Available examples

- [Basic site spec](/examples/basic/) — simple Astro + Starlight documentation site
- More examples coming soon

## Using examples

Copy any example spec to your project root as `spec.sodl`, then reference it in Cursor or Claude:

```
@spec.sodl build the UIComponents module
```

The AI will use the spec to understand your stack, constraints, and intent before generating any code.
